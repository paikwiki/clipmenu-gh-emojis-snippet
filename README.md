# Clipmenu GH-Emojis Snippet

Emoji snippet of [Clipmenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/)(for MacOSX).

Some emoji of MacOSX doesn't work on Github. So I made this to purpose to use
emoji with github markdown emoji markup and [Clipmenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/).

[Clipmenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/) has not updated since 2010,
but it works nicely! :grinning:

I found the list of emojis in [rxaviers's gist](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).
Some emoji that did not work was removed. :scissors:
